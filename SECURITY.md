## Important Notice

The testing guides and tools provided in this repository are designed for **educational and professional security assessment purposes only**. They are intended to be used in **authorized and controlled environments** such as your own lab setup, approved client engagements, or explicitly permitted test environments.

## Warning: Risks of Improper Use

- **Unauthorized use or testing of systems without explicit permission is illegal and unethical.** It may result in severe legal consequences including criminal charges, civil liability, and financial penalties.
- Using these guides or techniques on live production systems without proper authorization can cause:

  - Exposure of sensitive information
  - Permanent damage to systems or networks
- Testing without adequate backups or rollback plans can lead to irreversible harm.

## Recommended Best Practices

- **Always obtain explicit, documented authorization** before conducting any security testing on systems that are not your own.
- Use **isolated test environments** (e.g., lab VMs, staging servers) that mirror production as closely as possible without risking real users or data.
- Follow all relevant laws, regulations, and organizational policies related to cybersecurity testing.
- Ensure testing activities are conducted in a controlled manner with clear communication to stakeholders.
- Use responsible disclosure procedures if vulnerabilities are found.
