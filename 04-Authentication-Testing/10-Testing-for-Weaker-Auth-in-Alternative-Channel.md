# Testing for Weaker Authentication in Alternative Channel

## Overview

Testing for Weaker Authentication in Alternative Channel (WSTG-AUTH-10) involves verifying that alternative authentication channels, such as mobile apps, APIs, or legacy interfaces, enforce the same level of security as the primary web application. According to OWASP, weaker authentication in alternative channels—such as lenient password policies, missing multi-factor authentication (MFA), or insecure session management—can allow attackers to bypass stronger controls. This test focuses on evaluating authentication strength, rate limiting, session token security, MFA enforcement, and response safety in alternative channels to ensure consistent security.

**Impact**: Weaker authentication in alternative channels can lead to:
- Unauthorized access to user accounts via less secure channels.
- Exploitation of weak passwords or missing MFA.
- Session hijacking due to insecure token handling.
- Non-compliance with security standards (e.g., NIST 800-63B, PCI DSS).

This guide provides a practical, hands-on methodology for testing weaker authentication vulnerabilities in alternative channels, adhering to OWASP’s WSTG-AUTH-10, with detailed tool setups, specific commands integrated into test steps, remediation strategies, and ethical considerations for professional penetration testing. 

**Ethical Note**: Obtain explicit permission for testing, as submitting multiple authentication requests or intercepting API traffic may trigger security alerts or violate terms of service.

## Testing Tools

The following tools are recommended for testing weaker authentication in alternative channels, with setup and configuration instructions:

- **Burp Suite Community Edition**: Intercepts and manipulates requests to compare authentication mechanisms and analyze tokens.
  - Download from [PortSwigger](https://portswigger.net/burp/communitydownload).
  - Configure browser proxy: 127.0.0.1:8080 (Firefox recommended).
  - Enable “Intercept” in Proxy tab.

- **cURL**: Sends requests to test rate limiting and authentication in alternative channels.
  - Install on Linux:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install curl
    ```
  - Install on Windows/Mac: Pre-installed or download from [curl.se](https://curl.se/).

## Testing Methodology

This methodology follows OWASP’s black-box approach for WSTG-AUTH-10, focusing on testing authentication strength, rate limiting, session token security, MFA enforcement, and credential exposure in alternative channels.

### 1. Test Authentication Strength in Alternative Channels with Burp Suite

**Objective**: Ensure alternative channels enforce equivalent password policies, MFA, and session management as the primary channel.

**Steps**:
1. Configure Burp Suite by setting up the browser proxy (127.0.0.1:8080) and adding `example.com` to the target scope.
2. Submit an authentication request to an alternative channel (e.g., `POST /api/login`) with a weak password:
   ```
   HTTP History -> Select POST /api/login -> Send to Repeater
   ```
3. Compare with the primary channel (e.g., `POST /login`) by testing the same weak password:
   ```
   Repeater -> Change password=pass in POST /api/login and POST /login -> Click Send -> Compare responses
   ```
4. Analyze responses; expected secure response rejects weak passwords and requires MFA in both channels.

**Example Secure Response**:
```
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json
{"error": "Password must be at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters"}
```

**Example Vulnerable Response**:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
{"status": "Login successful", "token": "xyz123"}
[API accepts weak password, unlike web app]
```

**Remediation**:
- Enforce consistent password policies (Node.js):
  ```javascript
  app.post('/api/login', (req, res) => {
      const { password } = req.body;
      if (!/^(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[!@#$%^&*])[A-Za-z\d!@#$%^&*]{8,}$/.test(password)) {
          return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Password must be at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters' });
      }
      res.json({ status: 'success', token: generateToken() });
  });
  ```

**Tip**: Save Burp Suite Repeater responses as screenshots. Organize findings in a report with timestamps, test descriptions, and evidence of vulnerabilities (e.g., inconsistent policies).

### 2. Test Rate Limiting in Alternative Channels with cURL

**Objective**: Verify that alternative channels implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.

**Steps**:
1. Identify an alternative channel’s authentication endpoint (e.g., `POST /api/login`).
2. Submit multiple authentication attempts with incorrect credentials:
   ```bash
   curl -i -X POST -d "username=user&password=wrong" https://example.com/api/login
   ```
3. Repeat immediately to test rate limiting:
   ```bash
   curl -i -X POST -d "username=user&password=wrong2" https://example.com/api/login
   ```
4. Analyze responses; expected secure response includes rate limiting or lockout.

**Example Secure Response**:
```
HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
Content-Type: application/json
{"error": "Too many login attempts, please try again later"}
```

**Example Vulnerable Response**:
```
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
Content-Type: application/json
{"error": "Invalid credentials"}
[No rate limiting]
```

**Remediation**:
- Implement rate limiting (Node.js):
  ```javascript
  const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');
  app.use('/api/login', rateLimit({
      windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
      max: 5 // 5 attempts
  }));
  app.post('/api/login', (req, res) => {
      res.json({ status: 'success' });
  });
  ```

**Tip**: Save cURL commands and responses to a file (e.g., `curl -i ... > output.txt`). Organize findings in a report with timestamps, test descriptions, and evidence of vulnerabilities (e.g., lack of rate limiting).

### 3. Test Session Token Security in Alternative Channels with Burp Suite

**Objective**: Ensure session tokens issued by alternative channels are unpredictable, time-limited, and properly validated.

**Steps**:
1. Configure Burp Suite by setting up the browser proxy (127.0.0.1:8080) and adding `example.com` to the target scope.
2. Authenticate via an alternative channel and capture the session token:
   ```
   HTTP History -> Select POST /api/login -> Check Response for token
   ```
3. Test token predictability by requesting another token and reusing an old token:
   ```
   Repeater -> Change token=old_token in GET /api/profile -> Click Send -> Check response
   ```
4. Analyze responses; expected secure response includes unique, random tokens and rejection of invalid tokens.

**Example Secure Response**:
```
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
Content-Type: application/json
{"error": "Invalid or expired token"}
```

**Example Vulnerable Response**:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
{"data": "User profile"}
[Sequential tokens: token=123, token=124]
```

**Remediation**:
- Generate secure tokens (Python/Flask):
  ```python
  import secrets
  @app.post('/api/login')
  def api_login():
      token = secrets.token_hex(32)
      response = jsonify({'status': 'success', 'token': token})
      response.set_cookie('token', token, httponly=True, secure=True)
      return response
  ```

**Tip**: Save Burp Suite HTTP History responses as screenshots. Organize findings in a report with timestamps, test descriptions, and evidence of vulnerabilities (e.g., predictable tokens).

### 4. Test MFA Enforcement in Alternative Channels with Burp Suite

**Objective**: Ensure alternative channels require multi-factor authentication (MFA).

**Steps**:
1. Configure Burp Suite by setting up the browser proxy (127.0.0.1:8080) and adding `example.com` to the target scope.
2. Submit an authentication request to an alternative channel without MFA credentials:
   ```
   HTTP History -> Select POST /api/login -> Send to Repeater
   ```
3. Remove the MFA field and resend:
   ```
   Repeater -> Remove mfa_code field -> Click Send -> Check response
   ```
4. Analyze responses; expected secure response requires MFA.

**Example Secure Response**:
```
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
Content-Type: application/json
{"error": "Multi-factor authentication required"}
```

**Example Vulnerable Response**:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
{"status": "Login successful", "token": "xyz123"}
```

**Remediation**:
- Enforce MFA (Node.js):
  ```javascript
  app.post('/api/login', (req, res) => {
      const { username, password, mfa_code } = req.body;
      if (!mfa_code || !verifyMfaCode(mfa_code)) {
          return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Multi-factor authentication required' });
      }
      res.json({ status: 'success', token: generateToken() });
  });
  ```

**Tip**: Save Burp Suite Repeater responses as screenshots. Organize findings in a report with timestamps, test descriptions, and evidence of vulnerabilities (e.g., missing MFA).

### 5. Test Credential Exposure in Alternative Channel Responses with Burp Suite

**Objective**: Ensure alternative channels do not expose sensitive data in authentication responses.

**Steps**:
1. Configure Burp Suite by setting up the browser proxy (127.0.0.1:8080) and adding `example.com` to the target scope.
2. Submit an authentication request to an alternative channel and inspect the response:
   ```
   HTTP History -> Select POST /api/login -> Check Response for credentials
   ```
3. Check client-side code or API responses for leaks:
   ```
   HTTP History -> Select GET /api/profile -> Check HTML/JavaScript for token exposure
   ```
4. Analyze findings; expected secure response contains no credentials in responses or code.

**Example Secure Response**:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
{"status": "Login successful", "token": "xyz123"}
[No credentials in response or client-side code]
```

**Example Vulnerable Response**:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
{"status": "Login successful", "username": "user", "password": "pass123"}
```

**Remediation**:
- Avoid credential exposure (Python/Flask):
  ```python
  @app.post('/api/login')
  def api_login():
      # Authenticate user
      return jsonify({'status': 'success', 'token': generate_token()})
  ```

**Tip**: Save Burp Suite HTTP History responses as screenshots. Organize findings in a report with timestamps, test descriptions, and evidence of vulnerabilities (e.g., exposed credentials).
